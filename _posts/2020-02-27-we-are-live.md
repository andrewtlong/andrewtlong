title: We Are Live!
layout: post

After about four days of fiddling with .scss and Jekyll, my personal site is finally live! This is very much a work in progress, and more content will be added in the near future. I am still working on the organizational structure and some of the styling, but I believe that overall the base of this site will stay the same.

The first project I will upload will be my overhaul of my snapping turtle's tank. He's getting bigger, and he needs a better setup than what I've been using. I've been through three different filters since December 2019, each of them dying because of the substrate killing the impellars. I recently made the switch to a canister filter, which I was largely happy with, but came home yesterday to find that it had also died due to the intake of sand. 

I have been toying around with using a substrate like Fluorite and then planting some dwarf hairgrass or Java moss, and then covering that with river gravel to create a more natural habitat for him. I'd also like to increase the water level and provide a basking platform for him. As I post updates, they will appear here on homepage, and also on the <a href="/carlsagan">Carl Sagan</a> page.
