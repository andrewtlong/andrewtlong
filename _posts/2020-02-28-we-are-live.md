After about four days of fiddling with .scss and Jekyll, my personal site is finally live! This is very much a work in progress, and more content will be added in the near future. I am still working on the organizational structure and some of the styling, but I believe that overall the base of this site will stay the same.

I am currently in the process of designing a new layout for Carl Sagan's (my snapping turtle) aquarium. I think that will be the first project I'll share on this site.
