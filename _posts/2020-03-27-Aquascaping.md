I finally received all the items I needed to begin the transformation of Carl's tank. I purchased about 15 pounds of dark flourite for use as a substrate for the plants. ![Flourite](/assets/aquascaping202003/2020-03-05_13.36.40.jpeg =250x){:class="img-responsive"} 

I also bought 50 pounds of river gravel. ![River Gravel](/assets/aquascaping202003/2020-03-05_13.37.01.jpeg){:class="img-responsive"}

I decided to try Dwarf Baby's Tears as a starter plant, since they are easy to germinate and are very prolific. 

I started by filling a bucket with small batches of the flourite ![Bucket with flourite](/assets/aquascaping202003/2020-03-05_18.08.17.jpeg){:class="img-responsive"}. 

I rinsed it until the water was mostly clear. The picture here is from the initial rinse. It looks almost like chocolate milk! ![Rinsing flourite](/assets/aquascaping202003/2020-03-05_18.08.29.jpeg){:class="img-responsive"}

During this time, I also prepared a temporary tank for Carl while the seeds would germinate and grow for the next two weeks. I used a chunk of petrified wood and a sandstone rock as a basking/climbing spot for Carl. ![Temporary tank](/assets/aquascaping202003/2020-03-06_18.30.19.jpeg){:class="img-responsive"}

I rigged up my Penn Plax canister filter for use in the temporary tank, as well. ![Canister filter](/assets/aquascaping202003/2020-03-06_18.54.41.jpeg){:class="img-responsive"}

In about four days, the seeds started to sprout. ![Sprouts](/assets/aquascaping202003/2020-03-11_18.58.52.jpeg){:class="img-responsive"}

Within a few days, a nice carpet was starting to form. ![Carpet](/assets/aquascaping202003/2020-03-12_19.58.43.jpeg){:class="img-responsive"}

After about ten days, there was a dramatic difference in growth. ![Growth](/assets/aquascaping202003/2020-03-18_15.34.40.jpeg){:class="img-responsive"}

Finally, once the root structure looked solid enough and a pretty good carpet had spread, I began to lightly spread the river gravel in the tank and moved the basking/climbing rocks over as well. I slowly flooded the tank and installed the heater element and the canister filter and let it cycle for about three hours. Once the temperature was in the high seventies, I moved Carl into his new home. ![New setup](/assets/aquascaping202003/2020-03-18_16.04.22.jpeg){:class="img-responsive"}

Within fifteen minutes, he decided he didn't like the plants and started digging them up. ![Digging up the plants](/assets/aquascaping202003/2020-03-18_16.40.34.jpeg){:class="img-responsive"}

After about a week, he has all but destroyed the plants. ![Damage](/assets/aquascaping202003/2020-03-26_17.15.27.jpeg){:class="img-responsive"}

I have begun removing the floating plants from his tank and placing them into my minnow tank. So far, here is what he's dug up. ![Minnow tank](/assets/aquascaping202003/2020-03-26_17.15.19.jpeg){:class="img-responsive"}

I'm not sure what plants I should try next. I'd like to have a nice little aquascape for Carl, but I don't know what plants to try that he won't dig up.
