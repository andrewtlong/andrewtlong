<center>I finally received all the items I needed to begin the transformation of Carl's tank. I purchased about 15 pounds of dark flourite for use as a substrate for the plants.</center><br><center><img align="middle" src="/assets/aquascaping202003/2020-03-05_13.36.40.jpeg" width="400"></center><br>

<center>I also bought 50 pounds of river gravel.</center><br><center><img align="middle" src="/assets/aquascaping202003/2020-03-05_13.37.01.jpeg" width="400"></center><br>

<center>I decided to try Dwarf Baby's Tears as a starter plant, since they are easy to germinate and are very prolific.<br>

<center>I started by filling a bucket with small batches of the flourite.</center><br><center><img align="middle" src="/assets/aquascaping202003/2020-03-05_18.08.17.jpeg" width="400"></center><br>

<center>I rinsed it until the water was mostly clear. The picture here is from the initial rinse. It looks almost like chocolate milk! </center><br><center><img align="middle" src="/assets/aquascaping202003/2020-03-05_18.08.29.jpeg" width="400"></center><br>

<center>During this time, I also prepared a temporary tank for Carl while the seeds would germinate and grow for the next two weeks. I used a chunk of petrified wood and a sandstone rock as a basking/climbing spot for Carl. </center><br><center><img align="middle" src="/assets/aquascaping202003/2020-03-06_18.30.19.jpeg" width="400"></center><br>

<center>I rigged up my Penn Plax canister filter for use in the temporary tank, as well. </center><br><center><img align="middle" src="/assets/aquascaping202003/2020-03-06_18.54.41.jpeg" width="400"></center><br>

<center>In about four days, the seeds started to sprout. </center><br><center><img align="middle" src="/assets/aquascaping202003/2020-03-11_18.58.52.jpeg" width="400"></center><br>

<center>Within a few days, a nice carpet was starting to form. </center><br><center><img align="middle" src="/assets/aquascaping202003/2020-03-12_19.58.43.jpeg" width="400"></center><br>

<center>After about ten days, there was a dramatic difference in growth. </center><br><center><img align="middle" src="/assets/aquascaping202003/2020-03-18_15.34.40.jpeg" width="400"></center><br>

<center>Finally, once the root structure looked solid enough and a pretty good carpet had spread, I began to lightly spread the river gravel in the tank and moved the basking/climbing rocks over as well. I slowly flooded the tank and installed the heater element and the canister filter and let it cycle for about three hours. Once the temperature was in the high seventies, I moved Carl into his new home. </center><br><center><img align="middle" src="/assets/aquascaping202003/2020-03-18_16.04.22.jpeg" width="400"></center><br>

<center>Within fifteen minutes, he decided he didn't like the plants and started digging them up. </center><br><center><img align="middle" src="/assets/aquascaping202003/2020-03-18_16.40.34.jpeg" width="400"></center><br>

<center>After about a week, he has all but destroyed the plants. </center><br><center><img align="middle" src="/assets/aquascaping202003/2020-03-26_17.15.27.jpeg" width="400"></center><br>

<center>I have begun removing the floating plants from his tank and placing them into my minnow tank. So far, here is what he's dug up. </center><br><center><img align="middle" src="/assets/aquascaping202003/2020-03-26_17.15.19.jpeg" width="400"></center><br>

<center>I'm not sure what plants I should try next. I'd like to have a nice little aquascape for Carl, but I don't know what plants to try that he won't dig up.<br>
