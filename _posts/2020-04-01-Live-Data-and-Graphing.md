I've spent the last two days fiddling around with WeeWx, my RTL-SDR, and an Acurite 5-in-1 weather system. I have been following a few projects for some time now, and decided I'd like to try to implement them. The concept is simple: pull the data transmitted from the Acurite 5-in-1 at 433 MHz with the RTL-SDR, and feed that data into a system to parse, anaylze, and visualize it.

I had tried this once before on one of my older Linux server but had no luck. Having just built a new server recently with a newer LTS version of Lubuntu, I thought I'd give it another go. Again, I installed all the proper drivers, tested the reception succesfully, and installed and configure WeeWx. I implemented the SDR driver for WeeWx and manually tested the reception once again, and everything appeared to work in the console. However, I could not get the data to actually populate the WeeWx database.
