  <h1>Weather Database</h1>
  <h2>A Continuing Project</h2>
  <p>My dad is a weather geek. He started recording the weather back in the mid 1980s by hand, cataloging temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. Several years ago, I decided to save a few trees and convert his spreadsheets to a program where he could continue to add entries and easily look back on the data he had entered for amateur forecasting.</p>
  <p>But where to start? My initial iteration was to manually enter all of his data (about nine thousand entries) into an Excel spreadsheet. It was a tedious and agonizing effort, but in a few days I had manually entered all of his data into an easy-to-read format to which he could add at his leisure.</p>
  <p>Within a few weeks, I realized that it would be handier to simply have an input form and a database backend that he could filter and organize how he saw fit. I put together a simple webserver and SQL database and began working on a basic webpage that would submit new entries and show the previous data on a separate page.</p>
